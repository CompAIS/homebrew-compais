This repository is intended to be a tap for ```brew```. It is still under development, but the formulae uploaded should work. Report any issues with the issue tracker.

### How do I get set up? ###

Since ```brew``` only supports taps hosted on GitHub, you will need the external ```brew``` command, ```any-tap```. Tap [telemachus/anytap](https://github.com/telemachus/homebrew-anytap) and install ```any-tap```:

```
$ brew tap telemachus/anytap
$ brew install brew-any-tap
```

Now you can tap this repository

```
$ brew any-tap compais compais https://bitbucket.org/compais/homebrew-compais
```

```brew``` will now have access to all of the formulae hosted in this repository.
